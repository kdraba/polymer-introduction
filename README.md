## Current Step

### Going back to the roots

The Polymer Starter Kit is great. But I prefer learning by doing small steps and understanding changes line by line.
Hence i removed all the great content from the Polymer Startet Kit leaving us with the dreaded blank page.

Thats it for this step. Continue to the next commit ... yes you could really have skipped this one.

## Previous Steps

### Start

Welcome to my Polymer introduction and thank your for your interest!

To follow this introduction you need to follow the git commits in this repository in their historical order. Simply check out the first commit in repository history and follow me along by reading the [TALK.md](./TALK.md) file of each revision.

I suggest you use a tool like [Git Extensions](https://gitextensions.github.io/) ([latest release](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/releases/latest)) to follow the trail of commits.

The current project state your looking at is a plain [Polymer Development Kit 1.3.0 release](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit/releases/tag/v1.3.0) with some minor tweaks, e.g. a changed project name in [bower.json](./bower.json) and this new [README.md](./README.md) file added.

First install or update the dependencies and serve the Polymer Starter Kit, then have a look around.

Install or update dependencies:

```shell
npm install
npm install --save-dev bower
node_modules/.bin/bower install
```

Serve the Polymer Starter Kit:

```shell
node_modules/.bin/gulp serve
```

Take a look at the app running on [localhost](http://localhost:5000/) and at the [app/index.html](./app/index.html) file. Just hurry - because we are going to make it all go away when switching to our next commit :wink:.

Did you spot all those pretty material design custom HTML elements in the [app/index.html](./app/index.html) file? Could you map those element to their beautiful appearance int the [app](http://localhost:5000/)? - Sure you did, or did you not? Anyway, just stay with me as we use and build some simple elements in this introduction to shed some light basic Polymer principles.

In case you want to leave the introduction right away and experiment with the Polymer Starter Kit you can find informations in their original [ORIGINAL_README.md](./ORIGINAL_README.md).

Now it is time to switch to the next commit in repository history.
